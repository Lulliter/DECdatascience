This is a quick exploratory study to learn how to use the World Bank's API for the World Development Indicator (WDI) repository. 

In this study, I explore the indicator **_Life expectancy at birth_** and I also do some comparative analisys using other indicators that I expect to be highly correlated with life expectancy: namely **GDP** and the status of **Fragile and conflict affected situations** (FCS).
